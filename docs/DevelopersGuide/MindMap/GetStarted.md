#### Step 3: Adding other components
In the sidebar, you'll find draggable nodes for various components such as the Auth Provider (Keycloak), Database (Postgres and MongoDB), Service Discovery (Eureka), and Log Management (ECK). Drag these nodes onto your Mind Map to visualize the components in your project.

#### Step 4: Add Connections
Nodes in the designer can be connected using edges in the following ways.
##### Database Connection
Service/UI+Gateway node can be connected with a database to associate the service with it's corresponding DB.
