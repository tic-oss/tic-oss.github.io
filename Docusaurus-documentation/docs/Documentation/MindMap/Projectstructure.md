The structure of the project folder depends on whether you have selected a deployment infrastructure or not. Let's explore both scenarios

#### Scenario 1: No Deployment Infrastructure Selected
If you generated your project folder without selecting any deployment infrastructure, the folder structure will look as follows
``` { .sh .no-copy }
.
├─ {Client}
├─ {Backend}
├─ {Caller}
└─  Blueprints
```
In this scenario, the folder contains the following elements

##### Client 
This folder represents the client-side codebase of your project.
##### Backend
This folder represents the backend codebase of your project.
##### Caller 
This folder represents the caller service codebase of your project.
##### Blueprints
This folder contains two files a .json file and a .jdl file. These files define the architecture and structure of your project.

#### Scenario 2: Deployment Infrastructure Selected
If you generated your project folder after selecting a deployment infrastructure, the folder structure will include additional folders for deployment manifests. The structure will look as follows
``` { .sh .no-copy }
.
├─ {Client}
├─ {Backend}
├─ {Caller}
├─ Blueprints
├─ Kubernetes
└─ Terraform
```
In this scenario, the folder contains the following elements

##### Client 
This folder represents the client-side codebase of your project.
##### Backend 
This folder represents the backend codebase of your project.
##### Caller 
This folder represents the caller service codebase of your project.
##### Blueprints 
This folder contains the architecture definition files (json and jdl) for your project.
##### Kubernetes 
This folder contains application deployment manifest files for Kubernetes infrastructure.
##### Terraform 
This folder contains infrastructure deployment manifest files for Terraform.

In these structures defined, {Client} represents the folder name chosen by the user for their UI+gateway service, {Backend} represents the folder name for the microservice, and {Caller} represents the folder name for another microservice. These placeholders indicate that the actual folder names will depend on the specific names provided by the user during the project setup.
Please note that the actual names and contents of the folders may vary based on your specific project configuration. The provided structure serves as a general guideline for understanding the folder layout.
