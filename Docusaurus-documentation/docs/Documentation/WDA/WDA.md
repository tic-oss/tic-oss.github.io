# Description

A well-defined architecture is a clear and documented framework that outlines the components and their interactions in a system.

To obtain a WDA (Well-Defined Architecture) for your application, you will need to provide detailed information about the application and deployment. 

Firstly, you will need to provide information about your application. This information will help us understand the context in which your WDA will be used and ensure that it is aligned with your business objectives.

You will need to provide information about the deployment environment, including the hardware, software, and network infrastructure that will be used to host your WDA. This information will help us ensure that your architecture is properly configured and optimized for performance, security, and scalability.

To provide you with a better understanding, we have given more detailed information and  the possible values of the three parameters, namely application, communication and deployment. By understanding the range of possible values for each of these parameters, we can ensure that our response is accurate and comprehensive.
