# Description

To define the Infrastructure for your project, we require some details that will help us create a Well Defined Infrastructure (WDI). The information needed includes the project name, your domain name, your preferred cloud provider, your preferred orchestration provider, cluster name, Kubernetes namespace, monitoring and the ingress type.

The project name will be the name of your project, and the domain name will be the domain name for your application. You will also need to select your preferred cloud provider, which is where your application will be hosted. We currently support AWS Cloud, Azure Cloud and Google cloud platform.

For orchestration, we support Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Apache MESOS and you will need to provide a cluster name and a Kubernetes namespace. 

Additionally, you will need to select your preferred ingress type, which can be either Istio, Traefix or Nginx. With this information, we will create a WDI that will allow you to deploy and run your application with ease.
