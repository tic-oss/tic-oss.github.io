# Prerequisites-WDI
Before getting started with WDI, there are some prerequisites to ensure the correct outcome:
## 1 . Terraform
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your infrastructure in a declarative way. With Terraform, you can automate the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of infrastructure across multiple cloud providers and on-premises data centers.

[Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
## 2 . Kubectl(Kubernetes command-line tool)
The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

[Install Kubectl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html)
## 3 . Cloud Provider
An active cloud provider account to which the infrastructure will be deployed.

    (As of now for use it's AWS)
