# Communication

Communication tab requires information, which would specify which client and server would communicate with each other. For better understanding here is an example:

Assume you have client named "Fe" and Server named as "be1" & another as "be2", and you want to establish communication between "Fe" and "be1".
so, for Client Name you would mention "Fe" and for Server Name you would mention "be1".
